pip install django djangorestframework
django-admin startproject music_controller
cd music_controller django-admin startapp api 
when in music_controller folder,
when booting up app for the first time:  python .\manage.py makemigrations
python .\manage.py migrate 
to run: python .\manage.py runserver
whenever we make changes in the models, we need to makemigrations
python .\manage.py makemigrations after that as usual, python .\manage.py migrate

for frontend
in music_controller dir,
django-admin startapp frontend
after setting up all the folder structure (for package.json)
npm init -y
after that, for bundling,
npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
after that, we install babel so that all browsers including the old ones can read latest version of JS
npm i @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react --save-dev
for react, 
npm i react react-dom --save-dev
for materialUI,
npm i @material-ui/core (this didnt work since I installed an new version of react) | if this didn't work, use
npm install @material-ui/core --legacy-peer-deps (this will install a supported version if there exists one)
for using async await in JS, 
npm install @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties (again had to --legacy-peer-deps because version was not supported) | therefore
npm install @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties --legacy-peer-deps
for react routing,
npm install react-router-dom --legacy-peer-deps
for materialUI icons, 
npm install @material-ui/icons --legacy-peer-deps (maybe use npm i @mui/material @mui/icons-material)

to run,
backend part:
cd music_controller
python .\manage.py runserver
frontend part:
cd frontend
npm run dev
